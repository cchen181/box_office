Extracting insight on what impacts a movie's total domestic gross 

In this project, I investigate which elements of a movie have the most impact on box office ticket sales. These findings may be used to influence and/or guide the decision-making of movie theater owners or movie distributors.  

**DATA**  
Data, obtained from [Box Office Mojo](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?page=1&view=releasedate&view2=domestic&yr=2017&p=.htm) , consist of all domestic movies released in 2017. While 738 movies were released that year, I limit the number in my study to those with a listed closed date. Information is scraped for each movie. This information includes:  
* movie  title 
* domestic gross
* number of theaters during its widest release
* distributor
* genre
* MPAA Rating
* month of release
* movie runtime
* production budget
* number of days in release
* months the movie was in the theater 
* movie director
