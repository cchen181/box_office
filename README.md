Extracting insight on what impacts a movie's total domestic gross 

In this project, I investigate which elements of a movie have the most impact on box office ticket sales. These findings may be used to influence and/or guide decision making of movie theater owners or movie distributors.

Data from all domestic movies released in 2017 is obtained from Box Office Mojo (http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?page=1&view=releasedate&view2=domestic&yr=2017&p=.htm).  Details include studio, total gross, number of theaters, etc. While 738 movies were released that year, I limited the number in my study to those with a listed closed date.
