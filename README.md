Extracting insight on what impacts a movie's total domestic gross 

In this project, I investigate which elements of a movie have the most impact on box office ticket sales. These findings may be used to influence and/or guide the decision-making of movie theater owners or movie distributors.  

**DATA**  
Data, obtained from [Box Office Mojo](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?page=1&view=releasedate&view2=domestic&yr=2017&p=.htm) , consist of all domestic movies released in 2017. While 738 movies were released that year, I limit the number in my study to those with a listed closed date. Information is scraped for each movie. This information includes:  
* the movie title 
* the domestic gross
* the number of theaters during its widest release
* the distributor
* the genre
* the MPAA Rating
* the month of release
* the movie runtime
* the production budget
* the number of days in release
* the months the movie was in the theater 
* the movie director
